> #How to play
> Blackjack is a card game in which you are trying to beat the dealer by scoring closer to 21. The catch is that you cannot ‘bust’ and your hand cannot exceed the value of 21 or you automatically lose the round.
> 
> ###Card Values
> Card values in blackjack are incredibly straightforward to understand. Number cards are valued at the number they have written on them and any face card (Jack, Queen, or King) is worth 10.
> >Aces either have a value of 1 or 11 and depending on the rest of your cards.
> 
>Once the cards are on the table, the player opts to either hit or stay depending on how close the value of their cards are to 21.
> ###Hit 
> Hitting is the term for receiving another card in your hand after the initial deal of two. If your cards are significantly lower than 21, then you should hit. If your current combination is 17 or higher then regardless of the dealers up-cards you should stand.
> ###Stand
> Standing occurs when you wish to stop receiving cards and believe that your hand will hold up as the best hand or, alternatively, if you hit then you are very likely to bust.
